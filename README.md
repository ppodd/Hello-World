# Hello-World

Well I am meant to write a bit about myself here so I'll just say that I am practicing and learning code and all of this stuff seems like quite a lot to take in. All these random websites to do this, that, and the other. And the convoluted way code is written - seems strange and overly complicated to me for some reason.
